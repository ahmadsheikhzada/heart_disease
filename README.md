In this project we perform extensive EDA using heart disease dataset. In addition, using GridSearchCV and Pipeline methods, we try to find the best algorithm for heart disease prediciton. At the end the subject of feature importance is discussed. For more information about the source of the dataset and feature description please see the jupyter file.
